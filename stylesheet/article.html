			<b>What is Art to me?</b><br/>
Something which makes me happy when I'm feeling low, which calms me.<br/>
I started drawing when I'm in 6th standard.Obviously, at that time I was not that much perfect but I didn't gave up. I tried and tried so many times. And now this time, I can draw portraits too.<br/>
 My dream is to make a portrait which is bigger than me.Then, I'll click pictures with it. Haha! Yes, Dreams are incomparable. Every artist has a dream. <br/>

Everything you can imagine is real. Painting is self discovery. Every good artist paints what they are. One must picture what life would look like without art.<br/>

Art is generally understood as any activity or product done by people with a communicative or aesthetic purposeâ€”something that expresses an idea, an emotion or, more generally, a world view.<br/>

As it is beautifully said-
